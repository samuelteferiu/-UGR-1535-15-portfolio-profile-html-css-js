            <h1>Foreign language</h1>
            <p>Since I place a high importance on personal development, I have always tried to learn several languages. The foreign languages I have studied and my experiences with them are listed below.
            </p>
            <h2>English</h2>
            <img src="../images/englishimage.jpg" alt="englishimage"> 
            <p>Since English is regarded as a necessary language in many African nations, it was the first foreign language I learnt. 
                It is the language I am most fluent in, though I am still working toward mastery. </p>
            <h2>French</h2>
            <img src="../images/frenchimage.png" alt="frenchimage"> 
            <p>In my early school years, French became my second foreign language. At first, I didn't realize how important learning a second language was. 
                But I went on to study French in high school and received an A1 certification.
            </p>
            <h2>Arabic</h2>
            <img src="../images/arabicimage.png" alt="arabicimage">
            <p>I learned Arabic by accident, mostly as a result of my childhood fascination with Arabic cartoon films. 
                I hope to become proficient in it in the future.
