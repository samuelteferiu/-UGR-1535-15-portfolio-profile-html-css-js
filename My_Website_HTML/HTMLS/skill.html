          <p>Since English is regarded as a necessary language in many African nations, it was the first foreign language I learnt. 
             It is the language I am most fluent in, though I am still working toward mastery. </p>

          <p>In my early school years, French became my second foreign language. At first, I didn't realize how important learning a second language was. 
             But I went on to study French in high school and received an A1 certification.

          <p>I learned Arabic by accident, mostly as a result of my childhood fascination with Arabic cartoon films. 
             I hope to become proficient in it in the future.
