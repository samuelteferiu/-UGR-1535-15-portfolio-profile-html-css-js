            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>I have many hobbies, but listing all of them would take up too much space. Here are the top three hobbies that I enjoy the most.
            </p>
            <h2>Drawing</h2>
            <p>Art has always been very important to me. I began doing it as a child, and I've gotten much better over the years. 
                Here are some of my pieces of art:</p>
                <img src="../images/myart1.jpg" alt="myart1">
                <img src="../images/myart2.jpg" alt="myart2">
                <img src="../images/myart3.jpg" alt="myart3"> 
            <h2>Video games</h2>
            <p>Playing video games is a fantastic way to kill time and unwind. I don't play games to compete, 
                but only for fun and enjoyment.
            </p>   
            <img src="../images/gameimage.jpg" alt="gameimage">
            <h2>Roller skating</h2>
            <p>I have developed a deep affection for roller skating, a relatively new pastime. It's a sport that demands tenacity 
                because progress frequently occurs following numerous setbacks. It accurately depicts life. </p>

            <h1>Travel</h1>
            <p>This section showcases my favorite locations, whether I've been there already or have travel plans to see them.</p>
            <h2>France</h2>
            <p>France, the land of art, is a destination I dream of visiting for its incredible museums. Although 
                some of the art pieces were acquired controversially, its cultural richness is unparalleled.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/franceimage.jpg" alt="franceimage">
            <h2>Japan</h2>
            <p>As a hub for manga and anime art, Japan is another place Iâ€™d love to explore. 
                Learning about the creative processes behind their art would be an incredible experience.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/japanimage.jpg" alt="japanimage">
            <h2>Switzerland</h2>
            <p>Switzerland is on my list for one main reason: its world-famous, delicious chocolates.</p>

            <h1>Dream</h1>
            <p>Like many others, I aspire to be financially independent, retire by the age of fifty, and give my family a good existence. But my goal is more than just financial security.
                 Without the limitations of daily job, I want to build a life where I can have greater flexibility, spend time with loved ones, and follow my passions. I hope to see destinations 
                 I've always wanted to see, learn about other cultures, and acquire experiences that will broaden my horizons and improve my quality of life. Being financially independent will enable me
                  to contribute to worthwhile projects, educate others, or support causes close to my heart. Essentially, my goal is to use my riches to build a healthy, satisfying life rather than merely
                   accumulating it.
