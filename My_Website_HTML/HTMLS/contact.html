        <h1>Fullname</h1>
        <p>Hello, My name is Samuel Teferi Flatie. My parents' names are Mr. Teferi Flatie and Mrs. Haimanot Tadesse. I am their second kid. 
            Growing up in a loving and close-knit family taught me values like honesty, discipline, and mutual respect.
            My formative experiences had a huge impact on my personal values and social ties. 
            I consider it an honor to uphold the principles taught by my parents.</p>
